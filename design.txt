quiz game

The program must have:
    Option to create quiz
    Option to play through quiz
        Track player score when playing
    Quizzes must be at least 5 questions long
    Created quizzes must be saved somehow so they persist through closing the program.
        able to delete created quizzes from the app
    Answers must be multiple choice

Any language
GUI or CLI

Once you have completed your project, you can submit it to ⁠week-1-quiz-game. Please refrain from copying other people's work (we will check for this).

And with that, best of luck and happy coding
